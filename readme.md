#Voteit app

In an effort to learn react I followed a tutorial on tutsplus where we built an app written in react that pulls its data from firebase. 

## To view the project

1. clone this repo
2. run npm install 
3. in the transpiled server directory run a basic server

My prefered server software: [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
